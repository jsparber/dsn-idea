# dsn-idea
Just another distributed social network idea (just some thoughts)

##Main idea
The webclient retrieves all posts of other users(friends), independent from its source server and merges them in a microblogging feed.

## Authentication
Each user stores a keyring (similar to a web of trust). If a user adds a new friend they will exchange there keys.
